# Basics of Rust
```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello Rust !");
}
```

```bash
Priax@fedora-39:~/Projets_perso/RUST/test_projet/workshop$ rustc main.rs
Priax@fedora-39:~/Projets_perso/RUST/test_projet/workshop$ ./main
Hello Rust !
Priax@fedora-39:~/Projets_perso/RUST/test_projet/workshop$
```

As you can see, it's not much different from C.<br>
fn means "func" (a function), main is main, print is print.
<br> You shouldn't be too lost when typing in Rust.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything at first, you can always come back here for more informations (be curious !)

You're encouraged to test any program your find in the courses.

*I won't go over everything in Rust, but you're free to look at the documentation, there's a LOT to learn !*
